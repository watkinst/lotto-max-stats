# Lotto-Max-Stats

A Lotto Max statistics dashboard built with React and using Facebook's Flux application architecture.

## Motivation

I wanted to prove to myself how infinitesimally small my chances of ever winning the Lotto Max jackpot were. I also wanted to learn React and Flux, and I needed a decent data set to work with. In retrospect, I would have used a web scraper to get the Lotto Max draw results instead of manually building a JSON file to read from.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
1. `cd` into the `lotto-max-stats` directory and run `npm install`.

## Usage

1. Run `npm run dev`.
1. View the running application in your browser at `localhost:8080`.
